# GDSC Inductions 2025

Welcome to my submissions for the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Inductions 2025!

## Machine Learning
### Task 1: Book Recommender System
A machine learning-based book recommender system using:
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF):** Uses user-item interactions (SVD) to find similar users and recommend books.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend books similar to those a user likes.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both CF and content-based methods for better recommendations.

🔹 **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

🔹 **Features:**
- User-based and content-based recommendations
- Interactive Streamlit web app
- Model evaluation using RMSE
